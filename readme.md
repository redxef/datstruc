# A data structure library for C

This library currently implements a singly linked, two directional list and a simple HashMap, which uses a linked list for collision resolving.

Both the linked list and the hash map can store arbitrary data inside them, either basic ones (integer, float) or complex ones, using a void pointer.

Potential deletion of allocated elements is left to the user.

See the test.c file for tests and example usage.
